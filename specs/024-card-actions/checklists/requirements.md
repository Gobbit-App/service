# Specification Quality Checklist: Card actions and icon buttons

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Backlog items 3 (actions inside the card, modern look), 7 (browse arrows), 9 (pink delete) and 10 (icons).
- Decision to confirm: form submits and dialog choices keep icon + label (FR-005); every other action is icon-only. Public pages out of scope.
